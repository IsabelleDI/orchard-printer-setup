    - Search "terminal"
    - Open the Terminal app
2. Run the install script
    - In the terminal, copy/paste the following text: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Developers-Institute/orchard-printer-setup/master/install-orchard-printer-mac.sh?token=AAPJLDT6SLSU3TCNE7DCSK265VKUK')"`

## For other operating systems

As we've only used MacOS so far, no other operating systems have been catered for by us yet.
